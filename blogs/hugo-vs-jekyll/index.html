<h2 id="developer-problems">Developer Problems</h2>

<p>As developers we always want to start writing our own blogs and give something back to the community which always has got our backs,
but its something that we mostly never get around to (well thats me anyways).
Who has time to write your own blogs when you have deadlines and prod bugs. But even if we make up our mind to start writing and clear on of your weekend schedules,
there comes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice">The Paradox of Choice</a> medium, ghpages etc etc.
The trick is to bite the bullet and choose one and stick to it. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I did.</p>

<h2 id="3rd-party-blogging-vs-doing-something-on-your-own">3rd party blogging vs doing something on your own</h2>

<p>Well I decided to build my own blog rather than using 3rd party blogging platforms (yeah I&rsquo;m looking at you medium üï∂Ô∏è). Well my reasons where simple</p>

<ul>
<li>I wanted to design my own website</li>
<li>I wanted to get more fluent in markdown editing</li>
<li>I wanted a Static Site Generator and host it on ghpages</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ssg-wars-jekyll-vs-hugo">SSG Wars:  Jekyll vs Hugo</h2>

<p>When we come to SSGs there is no shortage of it we have Python SSGs, Ruby SSGs and possibly one for every programming language ever created.
My initial bias was towards python I was looking into (Nikola, Hyde, Pelikan) but to be honest its a bit difficult to configure these although they give you a huge set of features, I didn&rsquo;t have that requirement and wanted to go with something simple and something with a more aesthetic theming.</p>

<h3 id="enter-jekyll">Enter Jekyll</h3>

<p>Jekyll is one of the most popular SSG with a lot of themeing and additional functionality.
Its a great platform for content creators. Although this is purely my opinion but i found some shortcoming as</p>

<ul>
<li>It was a bit slow</li>
<li>Was built with ruby and i&rsquo;ve not worked with ruby before</li>
</ul>

<p>so I decided to <strong>Go</strong> against it ( see what i did there ).</p>

<h3 id="enter-hugo">Enter Hugo</h3>

<p>Hugo was the perfect fit for my requirements and I could see some additional benefits of using it as well</p>

<ul>
<li>Its performant</li>
<li>Has a plethora of themes for most common use cases</li>
<li>I get to play around with Golang (win-win)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>

<p>To all the developers out there find your motivation to write something because as a wise man once said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúPrograms must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.‚Äù
<div style="text-align: right"> - Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs </div></p>
</blockquote>

<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you choose a different writing platform of if you build your own Static Site. Just do it.
But if you are looking for an SSG, go for Hugo and you won&rsquo;t be dissapointed ;).</p>
