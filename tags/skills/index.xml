      <description>I have been writing code from my college days and been doing it for a living sice 2015.
I really enjoy working in the startup environment and currently working as Technical Consultant at TarkaLabs.
I love building/breaking and building stuff again (although preferably not in prod). For the past 1 year have been working fully remote and enjoying it very much. Currently learning to pick up the functional way getting things done.</description>
